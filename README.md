# Docker Node Hostname
This program creates a endpoint to get the Docker Node Hostname.  

The options are:  
* **bind** - The ip to bind (default 0.0.0.0)  
* **port** - The port to listen (default 5000)  

You can run it locally with Docker using the script ***build_and_run.sh*** included in this repository.  

The Docker Image (jonasmartinez/docker-node-hostname) can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/jonasmartinez/docker-node-hostname
